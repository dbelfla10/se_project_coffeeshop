# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- It would be great to add a feature that allow users to place an order. This feature would also be a form in which users can add items from the menu, specify quantities and fill contact info to set up the pick up.

- Instead of the recipes section showcasing recipes from other people, it could be a section showing actual footage of the coffee shop to show the user. This videos would be more like decorations in which autoplay would be applied to the style and then the video would be looping.
